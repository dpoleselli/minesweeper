# Minesweeper

My first Angular project

## Background

[Minesweeper](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)>) is a popular single player puzzle game that dates back to the 1960's. The objective is to clear a board of "mines" without accidentily denonating one. Many OS's come with some variation of the game installed by default.

As my first introduction to Angular I decided to build my own version of the game. However, in the context of the Covid-19 Pandemic, instead of mines, the objective is to identify all of the cells with the virus.
